# README

This is a fully operational Ruby on Rails online store (with the exception of payment handling). It has jQuery/AJAX functionality, an admin feature for all the CRUD actions, cart, orders, authentication and more.

To get it running, simply clone repo, run bundle install, rake db:migrate, seed the db to see the app in action and run the server!

To set an admin user, go to the rails console, select the user you want to use as admin and set it's admin attribute to equal 'true' (user.admin = true).
